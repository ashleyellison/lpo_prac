Assignment 6
=============


1. Using the user manual for your data, identify the appropriate probability weights to use for your analysis
1. Again from the user manual identify the appropriate variance estimation technique
1. Use the `svyset` command to identify the sampling approach to Stata
1. Calculate the mean or proportion of five different variables in your dataset without using the survey commands.
1. Again calculate the mean or proportion of the same five variables using the approriate weights and variance estimation.
1. Compare the proportions/means and their standard errors between the two approaches. In a comment in your do file, discuss why these difference between the naive approach and the other approach might be found, based on what you learned from last week's discussion of the sampling approach in your dataset.

LPO 9951

For this assignment, you will need to have access to the data you plan
to work with this semester (If you're working with a non-NCES dataset,
just use that dataset or one of the datasets we covered in
class). With the dataset, complete the following steps:

1. Using your research question from the first assignment
describe briefly 10 variables that you think might be relevant to this
study.

1. Using the dataset that you’d like to work with, find indicators to
match the variables you’re looking for.

1. Generate code to subset your chosen variables from the full dataset.

1. Describe the data you’ve selected. Include the following information in your description of each continuous indicator:

- Mean

- Standard error of the mean

- Median

- Number missing

For categorical indicators, I need a tabulation across the levels of the indicator, including a category for missing data.

NB: Skip weights, etc, and focus on your variables of interest.

For this assignment, you should submit a .do file that
subsets the variables you want from the full dataset and
generates the proper descriptive statistics. Save the resulting file
as your analysis file.
